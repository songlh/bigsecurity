\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}

\vt{} serves as a fruitful resource to understand malware and anti-virus engines in the real world. 
In this paper, 
we conduct a thorough study on four months of \vt\ submission metadata.
We first study which factors correlate to submissions' detection rate 
and identified three factors: file size, submission history, and submitter reputation.
We then investigate the influence between different vendors. 
Our experimental results show that   
%influence models borrowed from social media analysis can help predict the temporal behavior of malware detection, 
some vendors are highly influenced by all other vendors
and cautions should be taken to use these detection results.
