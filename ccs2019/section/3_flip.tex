\section{Flipping and stable study}

\subsection{Hazard discussion}

Todo: add hazard discussion in this part before discussing flipping. 

Hazard caused by VT API? NO

Hazard caused by vendor misfunction? NO

conclusion: randomly appear, but quite frequently, affect lots of files

Conclusion: remove hazard before studying flipping?

Run experiments both with and without hazard

\subsection{Flipping}
a. For each file, we count  of flipping vendors and  of flipping times

b. For each vendor, we count  of flipping,  of flipping files, average flipping per file

\subsection{Stable}
a. We need some metrics to support our definition of ?stable? is reasonable.

b. Some metrics to show how long we need to wait until results become stable

\subsection{Conclusions}
