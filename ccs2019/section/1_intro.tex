\section{Introduction}

\textcolor{gray}{Combating malware is important.} 

Malwares threaten information facilities and cause a large amount of loss each year. Anti-malware tools improve rapidly to detect malwares. 
Nowadays, there are also online malware analysis services for malware detection, such as VirusTotal \cite{VirusTot68:online}. 
VirusTotal allows users to submit suspicious samples, and offers detection results for tens of anti-virus vendors.
VirusTotal has become an important platform for both anti-malware industry and academia.

Combating malware needs efforts from the whole community. VirusTotal is a website, combining vendors? new detection techniques. VirusTotal is widely used in industry.

Beyond industry, academia also widely uses VirusTotal for different purposes. 

Our measurement shows that research community is using VirusTotal in a wrong way. 

VirusTotal is used in a wrong way. 

The question we want to ask is whether academia uses VirusTotal in a correct way. If not, how should we use VirusTotal. 

Contribution:

a. We survey more than 100 academic paper and summarize how researchers use VirusTotal. We find two usage patterns.

b. We collect big data from VirusTotal and use these data to show that the current usage of VirusTotal is wrong. 

c. We build a prediction model to help better use VirusTotal
