\section{Conclusion}

Our findings shed light on how vendors can influence each other.
Our study results can serve as a quantitative measurement for vendors' influence in malware detection community. 
Previously, when combining results from different vendors, 
security experts simply treat each vendor equally and use the percentage of 
vendors labeling a file as malware as likelihood of the file to be a malware. 
Our model can provide a weight to each vendor 
when combining results from different vendors.  
Anti-virus vendors can also use our prediction model to detect possible false negatives in their products.
