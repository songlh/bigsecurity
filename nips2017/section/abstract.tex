In this paper, we modeled how influence propagates across different anti-virus 
vendors by using the largest real-world malware repository, \vt. 
Our study results confirmed a set of hypothesis and anecdotal assumptions
and revealed a few surprising new insights into anti-virus engines.
These results can shed light on future research directions
and assist both anti-virus vendors and normal users in their fight against malware.
