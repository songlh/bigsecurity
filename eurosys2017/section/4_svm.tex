\section{Malware Classification}
\label{sec:ssdeep}

ssdeep~\cite{ssdeep} is a program to compute fuzzy hashes. 
Similarity between calculated hash strings can serve as a good estimation for similarity between the two original files. 
ssdeep hash strings are also provided for each submitted file with other metadata fields by \vt. 
In this section, we explore the feasibility to build malware classifier and detector based on ssdeep similarity. 

Malware detectors mainly rely on signatures manually extracted by security researchers. 
ssdeep only takes static binary executable as inputs. 
If we can build malware detector based on ssdeep similarity, 
We can reduce or eliminate manual efforts in malware detection. 

\subsection{Data Collection}

\input{section/tbl_svm}

Microsoft has a good reputation in detecting PE malwares~\cite{SongAPsys2016}.
For each detected malware, Microsoft assigns it a tag, which contains type, platform, family, and variant information~\cite{microsoft}. 
We divide PE malwares into different groups, and malwares in the same group share the same Microsoft malware tag. 
We sample 10 groups, each of which with more than 10000 malwares.  
Microsoft tag and number of malwares in each sampled group are shown in Table~\ref{tab:benchmark}.

For each group, we sample 10000 malwares, and use these malwares in our following experiments. 

We compute the percentage of tailing malwares in each group. 
We call malwares, which have 0 similarity with all other samples in the same group, as tailing malwares. 
The percentage of tailing malwares for each sampled group is also shown in Table~\ref{tab:benchmark}. 

\subsection{Clustering Experiments}

\input{section/tbl_svm2}

Before we conduct classification experiments, 
we run clustering on each group firstly to understand whether malwares in each group looks similar to each other. 

The clustering algorithm we use is hierarchical clustering, 
which will iteratively merge two clusters with minimum distance until distance threshold or cluster number threshold is reached. 
We use distance as threshold in all clustering experiments. 
Given two malwares, we use 1 minus their ssdeep similarity as distance between two malwares. 
We use single linkage distance for distance between two clusters.

1. Future work about indexing ssdeep string
2. Upper bound
3. More data better results
4. Need human effort or dynamic information
