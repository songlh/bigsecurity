\section{Data Collection and Basic Properties}
\label{sec:meth}

In this section, we will discuss how we collect and preprocess data from VirusTotal. 
Some basic properties of our collected data are also presented in this section. 

\input{section/tbl_metadata}


We collect metadata for each submission through VirusTotalâ€™s distribution API. 
Distribution API keeps returning metadata for latest files submitted to VirusTotal.
Table~\ref{tab:fields} shows the metadata fields and their meaning.  
We began our data collection on May 7th 2016, 
and ended our data collection on September 6th 2016. 
We insert all collected metadata into a cassandra table by using the combination of sha256, source\_id, and timestamp as key.
In total, we collect metadata for 151 million submissions. 

\input{section/fig_type}

Figure~\ref{fig:type} shows the file type distribution for all submissions. 
Among all file types, \textit{Portable Executable} (PE) files have the largest number, 
which is the same as results from a previous study~\cite{SongAPsys2016}.
PE files occupy 51\% of all submissions. 
Web pages and malwares on Android have the second and third largest number of malwares, 
occupying 12\% and 8\% of all submissions respectively. 
Other popular file types include PDF, Text, compressed files, and Java files. 
This result is slightly different from the previous study~\cite{SongAPsys2016}. 

Similar to the previous study~\cite{SongAPsys2016}, 
we focus our study in this paper on PE files, 
and leave studies on other types of malwares in the future. 
If the type field for a submission is either ``Win32EXE'' or ``Win32DLL'', 
we consider the submission is a PE file. 
In total, we collect 76 million PE submissions. 
The number of submissions and the number of PE submissions 
we collected each day are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:subnum}. 

\input{section/fig_vendornum}

\input{section/fig_detectionrate}

For each PE submission, VirusTotal will use a bunch of anti-virus engines to analyze it.
As shown in Table~\ref{tab:fields}, 
total field is to represent the number of used anti-virus engines. 
Figure~\ref{fig:vendornum} shows the distribution for the number of used anti-virus engines. 
More than 99\% of PE submissions are analyzed by at least 50 anti-virus engines. 
Some anti-virus engines will label a submitted PE file as malware, while others will not. 
Positives field in Table~\ref{tab:fields} represents the number of anti-virus engines labeling the submission as malwares. 

$$ \textrm{\textit{Detection Rate}} = \dfrac{positives}{total + 1}$$

Detection rate represents the percentage of engines labeling the submission as malware. 
Adding one to total is to avoid dividing 0 exception, and more importantly, 
to give submissions labeled as malwares by more engines higher detection rate. 
For example, after adding one, submissions analyzed by 50 engines and detected by 50 engines will have a higher detection rate 
than submissions analyzed by 1 engine and detected by 1 engine. 
This formula shares the same intuition from previous work~\cite{GuoICSE2010}, when computing reputations for bug reporters. 
A larger detection rate usually indicates a more malicious malware suggested by analyzed anti-virus engines. 
Figure~\ref{fig:detectiorate} shows how detection rate distributes among all PE submissions. 


One PE file could be submitted more than once to VirusTotal. 
There are 6.72\% PE files submitted more than once to VirusTotal. 
On average, each PE file is submitted 1.19 times. 
Some anti-virus engines may produce different detection results when analyzing the same file for different submissions.
We assume there is influence among different anti-virus vendors, 
and this influence is a very important reason causing engines to change their results.
We will discuss how we model this influence and how to predict possible detection result change by using our model in Section~\ref{sec:influ}.

\input{section/fig_pesize}

Figure~\ref{fig:pesize} shows the file size distribution for PE submissions. 
The smallest PE file is only 129 bytes, and the largest one is more than 1 GB. 
99.58\% of PE file fall into the range from 4 KB to 32 MB. 

Like all other empirical study works, 
our findings and conclusions need to be considered with our methodology in mind. 
We use distribution API to download submissions' metadata from VirusTotal. 
There is no guarantee that all data can be successfully downloaded. 
It could be possible that some files are submitted to VirusTotal, 
but we fail to get their information from VirusTotal.
Although we have collected huge amount of malware information from VirusTotal,
we do believe that there are malwares never submitted to VirusTotal, 
or submitted to VirusTotal much later than they appear in the real world. 
However, there are no conceivable ways to study them.
We believe the 4-month malware information we collect can serve as a representative sample for malwares in the real world.
