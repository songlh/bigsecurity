\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}

\vt{} serves as a fruitful resource to understand malwares and anti-virus engines in the real world. 
In this paper, 
we conduct a thorough study on metadata \vt{} provides for each PE submission. 
We first study which factors correlate with submissions' detection rate. 
We find that most PE malwares have small to medium size, 
and source IDs' reputation is highly correlated with the detection rate of their submissions. 
We then try to model influence between different vendors. 
Our experimental results show that   
influence models borrowed from social media analysis can help predict the temporal behavior of malware detection, 
and some vendors are influenced by all other vendors.
Finally, we study whether data provided by \vt{} is enough to support classification tasks. 
We design several classifiers based on ssdeep similarity, and these classifiers have varied accuracy. 
We also identify a simple metric, which can predict accuracy for a given classification
task.
