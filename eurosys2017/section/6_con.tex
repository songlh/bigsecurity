\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con}

\vt{} serves as a fruitful resource to understand malwares and anti-virus engines in the real world. 
In this paper, 
we conduct a thorough study on four months of \vt\ submission metadata.
We first study which factors correlate to submissions' detection rate 
and identified three factors: file size, submission history, and submitter reputation.
We then investigate the influence between different vendors using a graph model borrowed from the social media analysis area. 
Our experimental results show that   
%influence models borrowed from social media analysis can help predict the temporal behavior of malware detection, 
some vendors are highly influenced by all other vendors
and cautions should be taken to use these detection results.
Finally, we study whether hash strings of files are enough to build accurate machine learning classifiers and predictors. 
We design several classifiers based on ssdeep similarity and these classifiers have varied accuracy. 
We also identify a simple metric that can predict accuracy for a given classification
task.
