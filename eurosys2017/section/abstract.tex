In this paper, we conduct a thorough empirical study on real-world malwares and anti-virus 
engines by examining the largest real malware repository, VIrusTotal. 
Our study is performed in three dimensions.
First, we study the correlation between malwaresâ€™ metadata and their detection rates. 
Second, we model how influence propagates among different anti-virus vendors. 
Finally, we explore the feasibility to build malware detectors based on ssdeep similarity.
