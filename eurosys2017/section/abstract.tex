In this paper, we conducted a thorough empirical study on real-world malwares and anti-virus 
engines by examining the largest real malware repository, \vt. 
Our study is performed in three dimensions.
First, we study the correlation between malwaresâ€™ metadata and their detection rates. 
Second, we model how influence propagates across different anti-virus vendors. 
Finally, we explore the feasibility to build machine learning malware detectors based only on hash values of files.
Our study results confirmed a set of hypothesis and anecdotal assumptions
and revealed a few surprising new insights into malwares and anti-virus engines.
Together with our machine learning framework, these results can shed light on future research directions
and assist both anti-virus vendors and normal users in their fight against malwares.
