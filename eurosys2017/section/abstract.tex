In this paper, we conducted a thorough empirical study on real-world malware and anti-virus 
engines by examining the largest real malware repository, \vt. 
Our study is performed in three dimensions.
First, we perform an analysis on various properties of submissions, submitting entities, and anti-virus engines in \vt.
Second, we study the correlation between malware's metadata and their detection rates. 
Finally, we model how influence propagates across different anti-virus vendors. 
Our study results confirmed a set of hypothesis and anecdotal assumptions
and revealed a few surprising new insights into malware and anti-virus engines.
These results can shed light on future research directions
and assist both anti-virus vendors and normal users in their fight against malware.
